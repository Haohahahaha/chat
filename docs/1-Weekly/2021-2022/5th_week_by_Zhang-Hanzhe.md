> ## From 4/25/2021 to 5/1/2021

I find that I didn't use English to write my tech blog... Whooo, it's really terrifying~

In this week, I began to recite political and English knowledge, exercising programming. I began to realize the strength of insisting.

This week, I continue to experience the changes in my thinking and made a series of ideological mobilizations. I think the subsequent changes of the system (that is, work and rest, Etc.) are also coming soon.

During this week, I focused more on editing the video (If you are interest in my creation, click here (video had deleted) ). So I didn't pay more attention to DSL. **PITY**.

I still have a strong enthusiasm to learn computer knowledge. Keep going!

Good Night.
