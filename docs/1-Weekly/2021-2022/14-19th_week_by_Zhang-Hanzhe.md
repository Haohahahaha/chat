## Summary of the 14-19th week

> I don't know how time flies so fast, I only remenber few worth-remember things. I know I must say something, otherwise I'll die from this world.

This summary will be devided into 2 parts: One part is about my school life; another one will say my pre-summer holiday -- both of them are not make me very satisfied.

I was in school during 14-15th week, for pass my final exam of 17 courses though I felt the pressure of them is few less than it. Oh yes, there also is a military-training by 10 days. At that time I try my best to pass them and get a better score -- I was to get a chance to minor participate in research programs. 

Then I go home by High-speed train, begin the new story of Project_city-impression (16-19th week). I went lots of new place in my hometown with my friends. I would never find that there are many beautiful scene if I didn't go out day by day. Though we met too many difficulties to stop this project, I still gain a lot.

I get some different but nomal experience, now I share with you:

- If I can't keep going today, I will be dying tomorrow. That means I must to keep learning and progressing all the time and I can't stop for a moment.
- I still can't feed myself, whether I want to admit it nor not. I still a student, videlicet, student is also a really formal profession, I just didn't realize it. If I want to get farther, I should make my study better and better, never ending.
- A compelete adult not only can feed himself, but also knows many many knowledge and have a certain amount of money for emergency response and disaster recovery. These required abilities have only one purpose: **to protect himself well**.
- For some courses or knowledges, it is the recognized focus but I'm not interested. I think I should improve my subjective initiative, which may be the only way to change that condition. Now I've changed my view of most of the hardware knowledge -- I think they are no less important than soft ware knowledge. And I have more aggressive confidence in the basic computer knowledge and its application.

This is a little article about my thinking condition *work/sleep mode*:

- I have to sigh that with the changes in the environment, the entire person's economy, work and rest, and life patterns have also undergone considerable changes. So I now have two modes: one is work mode and the other is sleep mode.
- Under the work mode, the economy of the whole person is at a low level-that is, to meet the basic needs of diet, hygiene, and study; work and rest are very regular: basically six in the morning and eleven in the evening, handling hygiene at noon; the pace of life becomes very Fast-use minutes as the time unit.
- In sleep mode, the personal economy is at a relatively high level-the main economic expenditure is on gatherings with friends, health care, new books and equipment, and a small amount of expenditure on personal non-essential consumption; in terms of time, it takes 12 to 15 hours a day During sleep, 3 to 4 hours are used for study, and the rest of the time is used for housework, meals, and entertainment (varies in proportions); the pace of life is slow, showing a relatively lazy state.
- It can be said that the degree of utilization of different resources under different modes is different. Different modes have different applicable scenarios: work is suitable for offensive subjects in unfamiliar areas, high-intensity and long-term learning; sleep is suitable for health and rehabilitation, recovery of physical fitness, and improvement of their overall quality (such as understanding and learning about some hobbies). Pay attention to it when using it.
- The mentality in different modes is also different. The key point is that when switching modes, the speed of mentality changes will be slower. Therefore, it is necessary to intervene in advance, that is, start to change at the end of each mode. The accumulated experience at this stage shows that there is a conflict between the final work meeting and the final exam. The most effective way to solve this problem is to conduct most of the next semester's in-depth study (referring to the number of subjects) during the winter and summer vacations.

-- "But everything can't be absolutely perfect", I thought, "Let them go with the wind." What I can do is do my best and do everything better and better. **Keep Going!**
