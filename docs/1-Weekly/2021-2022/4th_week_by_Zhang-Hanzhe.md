> ## From 4/10/2021 to 4/24/2021

I was affected by something urgent, and it will continue to affect me next week. Life is often not easy, but I will continue to fight.

This week I learned knowledge about `string` and `linkedÂ list`. And it's very basic. I pay more attention to other subjects like math, Eng, etc. So this week I don't think my programming skill has a obviously improvement.

As I am in a transition period, my learning efficiency has not been improved. The habit of persistence cannot be implemented particularly well. But this week, when the difficulties have increased, I feel even more commendable to persist in doing one thing.

After this important period, and after another period of time, I think I will make a small improvement. So I give myself 3 points: 2 for normal programming, 1 for my transition of thinking. (3/10)

Aha, It is impossible to withdraw from the group.

Later, I will put my latest results to my blog. Welcome to discuss!

> Keep going.
