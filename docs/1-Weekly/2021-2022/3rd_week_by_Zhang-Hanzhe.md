> ## From 4/10/2021 to 4/16/2021

This week I want to talk barely three things:

- practice
- aspiration
- persistence



Firstly, I want to talk about "*practice*". Why do we need to practice? We can understand the world objectively through our own practice, so that we can look at it rationally. The more we practice, the clearer we know. So it is a really easy-to-understand logic: practice, know; practice again, know again -- Repeatedly and endlessly. 

The second thing is "*ambition*". There is an old saying: no one can stand without ambition. For me, the nearest goal is to enter a university for graduate studies. And where to go? I think maybe I have the answer, but it's too early to speak out. Now I should study hard and lay a solid foundation. I wish all friends in the group HAVE your ambition.

At last, I think I also need to persistence. Without persistence, I'll never succeed. But I think, when I'm in the cycle of `practice` and `know`, of course I really like to do it -- with my little ambition, persistence may become easier.



This week, I started to get on the right track, and my life became regular. Though there are some difficulties and emergencies in my life, it is still better than the previous two weeks.

About programming practice, this week I've learned some knowledge of string. There are also steadily improving learning in high mathematics, English, and Linux. So I give myself 4 points (4/10).
