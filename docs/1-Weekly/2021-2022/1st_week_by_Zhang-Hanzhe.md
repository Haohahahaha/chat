# Summary of the first week

> From 3/26/2021 to 4/2/2021

I think I should learn from the most basic things. So this week I read the book called *Getting Started with classical algorithm contest (second edition)* , from its beginning. Though the practice in Chapter one is very easy, but when I tried to solve it again, **it also brings me lots of details of programming && algorithm knowledge**. (My note is in [another page](./algorithm_notes.html).) Except this, I've also learned many kinds of knowledge.

I think I didn't make many progress in algorithm, but I got lots of many other meaningful things. **I've also mastered basic operation of the *git*. And I had preliminary built my Blog.** Now I put my learning record on it everyday. **And I've sorted out my plan of this semester.** **And my team have some progress in team structure, team division and team strategy. These are meaningful, too.**

I **think my time management is not bad.** Because if I don't have good time management habits, I can't deal with more than a dozen school courses and insist on learning programming skills every day, let alone doing algorithmic problems in this group. **So my training efficiency is pretty good.**

As for the most difficult problem I've met this week, I think it's my health problem. **I have a bad cold.** Ohhh, it's really a tricky problem, isn't it? I don't think I have some success, I'm merely do things I should do. IF I must say a thing -- **I can basically write all documents in English, that's due to Frank, 3Q!**

**I don't think I can persist more than before, because the time of persistence is really too short for me. So I will continue to work hard and continue to persevere.**

**This week is only a beginning, so I give myself 3 points.(3/10)**

But I believe:
