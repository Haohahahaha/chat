> ## From 4/3/2021 to 4/9/2021

Introduction:

In this week I tried using LeetCode and UvaOJ to improve my program skill. But beacuse of the need to arrange and participate plenty of my team's work, the programming exercise is not sufficient...



Hello everyone! How time files. We have been doing programming exercise for two weeks. Here is my summary of this week, WELCOME to exchange your views!



I'm still a greenhand. Except my teamwork and learning tasks, I had few time to deal with exercising program. All I can do is stick to it. It's hard to say I get something. When I meet some difficulties, I often search it in Baidu && CSDN (Ashamed), although my horizon was broaden a little. So this week my improvement is merely trying new things.



My time arrangement is weakly. I have many useless but cumpulsory lesson to deal with. It really binds me. It also caused me to spend my non-class time only in the dormitory. REALLY BAD. I'm working hard to finish my courses this semester as soon as possible, so that I have full time to go to the library to improve myself. There is still hope. Within a few days, I am going to achieve my goals. I believe the situation will improve soon.



I have to say, everyone except me are so great! Your daily practise has a very high level!



**This week I'm not doing well, so I give myself 2 points.(2/10)**

> I will continue to work hard to persevere and overcome all difficulties.
