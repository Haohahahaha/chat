> ## From 5/1/2021 to 5/9/2021

This week is a very meaningful week. I began to replace my habits which does not adapt higher demand to these more suitable. Replace, it's really useful, So my schedule has updated importantly.

Three days during this period (0507 to 0509) I was doing an experiment to make sure that my schedule is available.

We know, things is not as good as you want. Regretly, I couldn't keep going. I restart the counter of my exercising programming with paying about ten yuan~ But I think every coin has two sides, the quality of exercising has improved a lot: I began draw a mind map for every problem. A strong way.

I change my task to which is about maths, politics, english and DSA. More importantly, I go for a walk everyday. It's time to strengthen my body. **Go Go Go!**

Probably that's all. Thanks for your reading.
