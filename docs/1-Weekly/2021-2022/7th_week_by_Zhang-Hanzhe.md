> I really don't want to write week summary with english, but I think it's indeed a rare oppotunity to exercise english. So I'll keep going. (laugh)

This week I lost many chance to seize the time, for example, sometime when I go to bed, I would continue chatting with my friends; and I would delay after having tidied up my bed and workspace. I should pay more attention to these things and let it not to occupy more time.
The new two I found is communication with friend and hiking. As long as I have a slight negligence, it is easy to waste two or three hours.

And there is another difficulty in my life - that is unscheduled mandatory arrangements of the school. I think it has occupied six or eight hours  this week. I need free.

Although my schedule has merely changed formally for four days, I still can't control it easily. But I will not stop, I will continue to adapt to changes.

My schedule is geared towards PEE. In the future, I'll follow this idea to summarize the learning results of the week.

Let's start!

Math: from 9.11 to 9.13, quite slow;

Politics: 25 Single-choice questions everyday (xiao-1000);

English: IELTS C7T1/2/3 Listening & Reading, Speaking Exercise;

Professional Course (CS): DSA daily exercise -> hash, Frank's video course.

##### But in this period I have to study the school courses carefully to get a higher score so that I can meet the requirements for the next step.

The fifth -- School Curriculum: I just started the study of _physics_ and _circut technology_.

**Progress has been made in many areas. I will correct my mistakes and continue to increase efforts to move forward.**
