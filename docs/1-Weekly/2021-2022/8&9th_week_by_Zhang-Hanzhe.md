# Summary of the 8&9th week

> From 5/14/2021 to 5/17/2021



Two weeks are combined into one week, and this period of time is mainly used to adjust myself.
Letâ€™s talk about the schedule first:
Spur Line 1: A school and sports meeting (from 5/14 to 5/18)
Branch 2: Make-up lesson + mad make-up task (from 5/16 to 5/18)(?)
Branch 3: Determine the next step of video production-research and study, and be prepared in terms of knowledge, equipment, materials, and language. (From 5/18 to 5/27)
Spur Line 4: Strive for high grade points (from 5/19 to 5/27)
Spur Line 5: A big interview and big discussion, I conduct investigation and research and form a thought dynamic report (from 5/19 to 5/26)

The specific content is not shown, so let's summarize it.
The schedule is unreasonable. Now it is a big problem to go to bed late and get up early and sleep more time.
With the continuous development of exercise, the time utilization rate decreased.
This makes my most basic tasks impossible to complete, and I need to constantly adjust.
I have made some small progress in thinking, mainly because my vision has expanded a little bit. Although there is not much progress, it is very important.
My research direction is generally determined, but I still need to continue my detailed research and investigation work.

This half month is very turbulent.
But turbulent youth is more exciting.
Keep going.
