## Summary of the 23 week
Now I've been school for one week. In this week I've got a lot of experience of school life. 

There are some mistake I should correct:
1. I didn't insist on keeping a diary, I still think without diary, I can't control my daily life very precisely. 
2. I didn't execute according to plan that I need to learn advanced mathematic and analog electronic three days ago. 
3. I can't balance daily tasks and planning tasks, which reflected in my daily tasks occupied my most energy everyday, and resulted in me not having enough time to complete planning tasks. 
4. There is also a personality problem, that is, I can't take my heart down for a long time (the content data shows that long time refers to more than three days).

But I also make some progress to push my life forward:
1. I've calculated my time and try to make my time used more effectively. 
2. I've rethought the rationality of my study plan, and found some places which can't adapt to the current situation.

Below I'll describe my experience this week:

From 8/29 to 8/31, I was preparing all things included basic necessities and apply for exempt courses. 
From 9/1 to 9/3, I continue applying and make a accurate plan for the next semester, unfortunately, my computer have some bugs, and I have to re-install windows (Take this opportunity, I change the OS to Windows 10 Pro N. And I made a electronic ledger using excel, it can help me manage my money easier.
In this weekend, I organized the old photos and videos in the mobile hard disk and formed a photo-video database basically, which is about 250 giga bytes. Today, I launched my research about file system and learn how it runs.
In this week, I go out of school two times to fresh and relax myself. Life is hard, I'll keep going again, again and again.
