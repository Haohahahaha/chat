## Summary of the 24 week

>  The second week is really tough. I didn't eat good food, have a good sleep. I'm really tired. But what I never changed, that is, I still keep going.

This week I've done lots of summary. Here they are:

0907 -- About my plan and direction

0908 -- 

1. An impetuous psychology

   2. A person's cash I/O stream

   3. People who are far away from the negativer will feel much calmer.

   4. My present difficulties analyzation


0913 -- Improving quality and efficiency is the theme of my recent life.

### 0907 

About my plan and direction

I just talked to my friends about IC, IT. Now that I think about it, my original intention is probably to fully release the performance of the computer and improve its efficiency. And then I want to take care of both the software and hardware of the computer.

But it's impossible for people not to be specialized.

Now I understand, I can start with software, but hardware, after all, it is not my CS specialty, so of course software is the priority.

Then the software optimization does have some hardware-oriented theories, which need me to learn carefully, so that I can do well in system-level programming, and the scheduling hardware will be more perfect. As for chip design, those are not what I should consider. I should focus on how to use the chip, and upper componets.

Well, this is my direction. The OS and so on mentioned before is merely a vague concept, it's just an immature idea which is in terms of concretizing my research direction. This time, we will use scientific theories and flick the head and tail — that is, after drawing the knowledge map, I will directly carry out detailed research on each branch, and then i'll through the first refinement into an intermediate layer that can be connected to the knowledge map, and through the second refinement into the knowledge map. In this way, knowledge can probably become my own.

Moreover, the back-end, front-end, these employment-oriented categories are more professional; but the knowledge I may need to develop a software with a specific function is more than that. So inside the software, I need to be more erudite. In this way, if I create components or something by myself, I won't be too constrained by technology. But whether I talk about like creating components, employment, or postgraduate entrance examinations, the four core courses are indispensable. These are the core of the core, without these four courses, nothing can be connected.

It is time to modify the plan.

### 0908

【Brainstorming】

- I think I feel that the book is too superficial when I see few dozens of examples, and I feel too advanced when I see hundreds of examples. This is an impetuous psychology.


- **A person's cash I/O stream** should be controlled within a limit, which includes the following parameters: the peak limit of various expenditures, the upper limit of single-day expenditures, the weekly limit of initial expenditures, the peak-to-average ratio of expenditures, the bimodal interval, and the peak frequency (upper and lower limits); and reserve: whether the standard of reserve can be divided into three standards (or stages), namely, full backup survival condition + survival for 1 month, basic backup living condition + 2 months for life, full backup life Conditions + half a year of life.

    Everyone's income and expenditure are different at each stage. For example, when people reach middle age, they will face house, life (eating, hygiene, commuting), children and themselves (such as insurance, cosmetics + clothes, sports equipment + computer, etc.). As for me now, the main thing I face is only the part of my life (eating, hygiene) and the part of learning (online classes, books), plus some part of my own expansion (commuting = short-distance travel, some movies, going to restaurants). After the rough classification is clear, the entire bill will be clear, and then the financial status of both individuals and families can be well understood-of course, provided that there is no false accounting (or the false accounting rate is controlled within a very low rate).

- **People who are far away from the negativer will feel much calmer.** Recently I would like to listen to some old English songs from my friend, which is very emotional. *Bu Ke Dao, Tian Xia Jv, Wan Xiang Shuang Tian*, these top-ranked songs all show my mental state in the recent period-that is, forge ahead. I also listen to some Zongsheng Li's songs, such as *Shan Qiu, Wang Ming Zhi Tu, Yin Tian, Wo Shi Yi Zhi Xiao Xiao Niao*, the last one just heard one night by accident. Though I have been familiar with the lyrics for so many years, but that night I have too many feelings. "If you want to figure it out, it will take several years." After a few years, the tempering of people and things which I've met has become so important that I can't be ignored. Perhaps this is growth. Some lyrics inevitably sound so sad, but they hardly make me have a lot of mood swings. When I feel that I've grown up, I also feel that the burden on my body has become heavier, and my ability has become stronger.

- I found a problem in my mood. That is my instinctive reluctance to overcome the current difficulties. In terms that are acceptable to the general public, that is, I don't have the habit of developing long-term "investment" which brings growth efficiency gains. But I don’t think so. **I said, if there is something about the most difficult aspect of a plan, it is the present.** Being able to recognize the future and plan for the future is not the ability—only by exerting the greatest subjective initiative in the present desperately, can the reality in the hands of the present be transformed into the reality of the planned future step by step. 

    **Then there are new problems that arise with it: What difficulties will I encounter currently?** From my current situation, the physical education class every Monday can keep my body tired for the next week, and sleep time will increase significantly (from the five or six hours of the special eight-hour plan to the eight-hour sleep of the standard plan); Facing school tasks and learning tasks constitute a composite total task-it is updated and increased in real time, and it is also easy to be sharply reduced by each assaults. The duality of the general task requires me to look at it more objectively. It neither allows me to procrastinate in my daily tasks, nor does it allow me to advance in the general task. I must act in accordance with objective learning rules and a learning speed that suits me, otherwise it will be an abyss. From the perspective of work and rest, in terms of daily study and life, my life has formed a certain law -- it is like a computer program. If this step cannot be executed, then it may not only be impossible to execute the next step, but may also directly disrupt all subsequent arrangements. Then my daily learning tasks should develop such a habit and come up with a supporting environment (i should find syncable learning softwares to do adapted to multi-scene); the rest of the energy should be placed on assault learning tasks inside. The difficulty here is embodied in the disruption of the daily process, resulting in the delay of the task being executed and completed. In addition, I can go out of school when I have no class time in my subconscious mind. This concept is also a big factor that hinders me (in terms of subjective initiative); I am too tired at noon, but I have to take a bath, because it will only take the next day if I don’t wash. There is a chance, but it will be slow.

    Faced with these problems, perhaps the daily task reward is a reasonable statement, but after my thinking, I think that I am even more lacking in comparison and spurring. To some extent, heteronomy is indispensable but not overwhelming. Since I graduated from high school, my overall development direction has led me to pursue self-discipline and subconsciously resist other disciplines and contrasts. In fact, a certain degree of heteronomy and contrast can motivate oneself more. The theory of rewards doesn't work for me, it only makes me addicted to the illusion of "fake accounts".

    I will continue to explore this issue.

**I have to sigh: The word "degree" is the most difficult thing in a person's life.**

### 0913

**Improving quality and efficiency** is the theme of my recent life.
On Saturday, I went out to take the subway at night, although I fell asleep in the car.
But also looked at the previous diary.
Basically, there are no new problems.
In other words, they are all old problems.
(Listen to my words, like listen to the words~)
Then it's easy to solve.
Several aspects: sleep, diet, entertainment, communication, and study.
Now that I can figure it out, I need about 8 hours of sleep a day (if not stressful).
Normally, it is good to be able to do it for 7 hours (11-6), and I can get up smoothly in the morning.
I checked it just now, and now the average is 6 hours per day.
I only slept for 4h20min yesterday. I said why I was so sleepy.
In fact, 7 hours of sleep is enough.
In terms of diet, because of my lack of appetite recently, everything I eat feels dull.
The recipe should carefully refer to the previous practice-that is, two meals in the morning and lunch, not in the evening, in the morning: biscuits + spicy soup, and no drink for a bowl of rice at noon.
This amount of food is just right for the body's digestive system.
Don't eat indiscriminately just because you want to eat one day. This will affect your physical condition in the next two or three days.
Don't eat less, the consequences are the same. Because it will lead to overeating.
老子有言，“五色令人目盲，五音令人耳聋，五味令人口爽，驰骋畋猎令人心发狂，难得之货令人行妨。是以圣人为腹不为目，故去彼取此”（这段翻译不好，给出原文）: I During the period of study and retreat, I should pursue a relatively plain life.
For entertainment, that is, I shouldn't listen to songs all the time. Even the scene will be more awkward.
Don't use bilibili to listen to songs all the time. It's easy to watch the video.
Unplug the headphones -- this is the first step to concentrate on learning and thinking.
In terms of communication, the most every day is to chat with friends.
The matter of retreat must be taken seriously.
I am now on an upward trend, and I must continue to work hard, work hard, and work harder.
I believe it will meet my expectations.
Oh yes, there is also the weather problem.
Whether it is spring, summer, autumn, or winter, it is especially easy to get sick when changing seasons.
So: keep your clothes ready, hot and cold often tune.
Then I will continue to firmly implement the 0905 resolution.
Do a good job and hold on to the details.
Okay, that's all.
